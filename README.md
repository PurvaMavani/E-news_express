# ENews Express: Fake News Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
ENews Express is a machine learning project aimed at detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model classifies news articles as real or fake based on textual features extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.

## 🔍 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing text data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing word distributions and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implementing classification models including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **NLP Techniques**: TF-IDF, Stopword Removal, Tokenization
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ENews-Express.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ENews-Express
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled news articles categorized as real or fake.
